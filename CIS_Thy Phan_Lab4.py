# This program will able to figure out the store bonus and employee bonus if we enter the monthly sales and percent of sales increases.

# declare local variables
monthlySales = 0  # monthly sales amount
storeAmount = 0  # store bonus amount
empAmount = 0  # employee bonus amount
salesIncrease = 0  # percent of sales increase
prompt = 'Enter the monthly sales:' # prompt will be a string literal

    

# This code gets the monthly sales

monthlySales = float(input(prompt))

# This code determines the store bonus

if monthlySales >= 110000:
	storeAmount = 6000
elif monthlySales >= 100000:
	storeAmount = 5000
elif monthlySales >= 90000:
	storeAmount = 4000
elif monthlySales >= 80000:
	storeAmount = 3000
else:
	storeAmount = 0



# This code gets the percent of increase in sales
salesIncrease = float(input('Enter the percent of sales increase:'))
salesIncrease = salesIncrease / 100


# This code determines the employee bonus
if salesIncrease >= .05:
	empAmount = 75
elif salesIncrease >= 0.04:
	empAmount = 50
elif salesIncrease >= 0.03:
	empAmount = 40
else:
	empAmount = 0

# This code prints the bonus information
print("The store bonus amount is $", storeAmount)
print("The employee bonus amount is $", empAmount)
if (storeAmount == 6000 ) and (empAmount == 75):
    print('Congrats! You have reached the highest bonus amounts possible! ')
